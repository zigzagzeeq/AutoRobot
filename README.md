## 5. Using Your Robot

### 5.1 How Interaction Works

#### The Robot's Process:
1. **Activation** (3 seconds): Robot starts up and initializes
2. **Detection** (7 seconds): Camera watches for your face and emotions
3. **Analysis** (2 seconds): AI determines your dominant emotion
4. **Response** (3 seconds): Robot speaks appropriate response
5. **Listening** (10 seconds): Robot waits for your voice response
6. **Support** (5 seconds): Robot provides helpful advice
7. **Activity** (5-15 minutes): Optional wellness exercises
8. **Loop**: Process repeats or ends based on your choice

#### Your Role:
- **Be visible**: Stay in camera view during emotion detection
- **Speak clearly**: Use normal speaking voice and pace
- **Be patient**: Allow robot time to process and respond
- **Engage honestly**: Share your feelings for better support

### 5.2 Emotion Detection

#### What Emotions Are Recognized?

| Emotion | What It Looks Like | Robot Response |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| üòä **Happy** | Smiling, bright eyes | Celebrates with you, suggests gratitude exercises |
| üò¢ **Sad** | Frowning, downcast eyes | Offers comfort, suggests breathing exercises |
| üò† **Angry** | Furrowed brow, tense jaw | Provides calming support, suggests relaxation |
| üò® **Fear** | Wide eyes, tense expression | Offers reassurance, suggests grounding exercises |
| üò≤ **Surprise** | Raised eyebrows, open mouth | Shows curiosity, helps process the surprise |
| ü§¢ **Disgust** | Wrinkled nose, negative expression | Offers understanding, suggests cleansing activities |
| üòê **Neutral** | Relaxed, no strong expression | Continues monitoring, casual conversation |

#### Tips for Better Detection:
- **Good lighting**: Avoid shadows on your face
- **Clear view**: Remove glasses or hats if they obstruct your face
- **Stay still**: Minimize movement during 7-second detection period
- **Express naturally**: Don't force expressions - be authentic
- **Multiple emotions**: Robot handles mixed emotions intelligently

### 5.3 Voice Interaction

#### Speaking to Your Robot:

**Best Practices:**
- **Speak clearly** at normal pace
- **Use normal volume** - don't shout or whisper
- **Pause between sentences** for better recognition
- **Avoid background noise** when possible
- **Be patient** - robot will indicate when it's listening

**Sample Conversations:**

**Robot:** "I can see you're feeling sad. What made you feel this way today?"

**You:** "I had a really difficult day at work. My boss was criticizing everything I did."

**Robot:** "That sounds really frustrating and hurtful. Work stress can be especially challenging when you feel like your efforts aren't being recognized. It's completely understandable that you'd feel sad about this."

**Common Voice Commands:**
- "Yes" / "No" - Respond to robot questions
- "I don't want to talk about it" - Skip topic
- "Can you repeat that?" - Ask for clarification
- "Stop" - End current activity
- "Continue" - Proceed with suggestion
- "Help" - Get usage instructions

### 5.4 Understanding Robot Behavior

#### Robot Personality:
Your robot has a consistent, caring personality:
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledges and validates your feelings
- **Patient**: Never rushes you or pressures you
- **Supportive**: Offers practical help and encouragement
- **Respectful**: Honors your boundaries and choices
- **Consistent**: Maintains the same caring approach

#### How Robot Makes Decisions:

**Emotion Conflicts:**
If robot detects multiple emotions equally:
1. **Removes "neutral"** if other emotions are present
2. **Randomly selects** from remaining tied emotions
3. **Explains its choice**: "I'm detecting mixed emotions - anger and sadness. I'll focus on the anger I'm sensing."

**Response Selection:**
Robot chooses responses based on:
- **Your current emotion** (primary factor)
- **Conversation history** (what you've discussed)
- **Your preferences** (learned over time)
- **Appropriate timing** (when to suggest activities)

- "You're stronger than you realize, and you've handled challenges before."
- "It's okay to feel this way - your emotions are valid."

#### 6.1.3 Clarifying Questions
**Purpose**: Understand your situation better

**Examples:**
- "Can you tell me more about what happened?"
- "How long have you been feeling this way?"

#### 6.1.4 Activity Suggestions
**Purpose**: Offer practical wellness activities

**Examples:**
- "Would you like to try a breathing exercise to help calm your mind?"

### 6.2 Conversation Flow

#### Typical Interaction Pattern:

1. **Greeting**: "Hello! I'm here to support you today."
2. **Emotion Check**: "I can see you're feeling [emotion]. That's completely understandable."
3. **Inquiry**: "What made you feel this way?"
4. **Listening**: Robot processes your response
5. **Support**: "That sounds really [challenging/exciting/etc]. [Supportive statement]"
6. **Suggestion**: "Would you like to try [activity] to help with this?"
7. **Activity or Continuation**: Either guides activity or continues conversation
8. **Check-in**: "How are you feeling now?"
9. **Closure**: "I'm here whenever you need support."

### 6.3 Adaptive Responses

#### How Robot Learns About You:

**Conversation Memory:**
- Remembers topics you've discussed in current session
- Refers back to things you've mentioned
- Avoids repeating the same suggestions

**Preference Learning:**
- Notes which activities you prefer
- Remembers your typical response patterns
- Adapts suggestion timing based on your preferences

**Emotional Pattern Recognition:**
- Recognizes your emotional patterns over time
- Adjusts responses based on your typical emotional intensity

### 9.3 Data Management

#### 9.3.1 Session Data

**Understanding Data Storage:**
- **Emotion history**: Stored temporarily during sessions
- **User preferences**: Saved locally for personalization
- **Performance metrics**: Used for system optimization
- **No personal data**: Conversations are not permanently stored

**Data Locations:**
```bash
# User preferences
~/.config/emotional_robot/user_preferences.json

# Performance logs
~/.ros/log/latest/

# Temporary session data
/tmp/emotional_robot_session/
```

#### 9.3.2 Privacy Protection

**Data Cleanup:**
```bash
# Clear temporary session data
rm -rf /tmp/emotional_robot_session/*

# Reset user preferences (if desired)
rm ~/.config/emotional_robot/user_preferences.json

# Clear interaction logs
rm -rf ~/.ros/log/*
```

**Privacy Settings:**
- **Local processing**: All emotion detection happens on your computer
- **Cloud services**: Only used for speech recognition (can be disabled)
- **No data sharing**: Your conversations are never transmitted or stored remotely
